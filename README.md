# Game_of_life
Game of life, cells live or die depending on 4 simple rules

Learn to code with the Head first - book series. This game is from "HG Learn to code".
Programming language is Python 3.

view.py
Handles what id displayed on the interface.
I have also included the different controlls here, the event-handlers for the buttons in the view.
*** The program is started from view.py! ***

model.py
Only cares about the data for the grid and cells, and how to compute new generations
Don't care or knows about the view.
